Description: Provide access to (SM)BIOS information -- dynamic library
 libsmbios aims towards providing access to as much BIOS information as
 possible. It does this by providing a library of functions that can be used 
 as well as sample binaries.
 .
 It incorporates extensible access to SMBIOS information capabilities and
 ability to perform unit tests across multiple systems without using physical
 hardware. Moreover, centralized, data-driven exception handling for broken 
 BIOS tables is provided. Currently, full access to the SMBIOS table and its 
 items is implemented. Additionally, access and manipulation of Dell Indexed 
 IO Token (type 0xD4) is implemented. This token is a vendor-extention 
 SMBIOS structure which allows uniform access to manipulate the system CMOS 
 to enable, disable, or otherwise manipulate normal BIOS functions or features.

Description: Provide access to (SM)BIOS information - development files
 libsmbios aims towards providing access to as much BIOS information as
 possible. It does this by providing a library of functions that can be

 .
 It incorporates extensible access to SMBIOS information capabilities and
 ability to perform unit tests across multiple systems without using physical

 BIOS tables is provided.
 .
 To start out with, the focus is on the SMBIOS tables. Currently, full access
 to the SMBIOS table and its items is implemented. In the future, it will
 provide $PIR, MPTABLE, RCI, RBU, and other tables as well.

 Additionally, access and manipulation of Dell Indexed IO Token (type 0xD4)
 is implemented. This token is a vendor-extention SMBIOS structure which
 allows uniform access to manipulate the system CMOS to enable, disable, or
